    """
    Log-barrier method for solving the problem:
        minimize    f(x, u) := 1/2 * ||Ax - b||_2^2 + reg_coef * \sum_i u_i
        subject to  -u_i <= x_i <= u_i.

    The method constructs the following barrier-approximation of the problem:
        phi_t(x, u) := t * f(x, u) - sum_i( log(u_i + x_i) + log(u_i - x_i) )
    and minimize it as unconstrained problem by Newton's method.

    In the outer loop `t` is increased and we have a sequence of approximations
        { phi_t(x, u) } and solutions { (x_t, u_t)^{*} } which converges in `t`
    to the solution of the original problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : np.array
        Feature matrix for the regression problem.
    b : np.array
        Given vector of responses.
    reg_coef : float
        Regularization coefficient.
    x_0 : np.array
        Starting value for x in optimization algorithm.
    u_0 : np.array
        Starting value for u in optimization algorithm.
    tolerance : float
        Epsilon value for the outer loop stopping criterion:
        Stop the outer loop (which iterates over `k`) when
            `duality_gap(x_k) <= tolerance`
    tolerance_inner : float
        Epsilon value for the inner loop stopping criterion.
        Stop the inner loop (which iterates over `l`) when
            `|| \nabla phi_t(x_k^l) ||_2^2 <= tolerance_inner * \| \nabla \phi_t(x_k) \|_2^2 `
    max_iter : int
        Maximum number of iterations for interior point method.
    max_iter_inner : int
        Maximum number of iterations for inner Newton's method.
    t_0 : float
        Starting value for `t`.
    gamma : float
        Multiplier for changing `t` during the iterations:
        t_{k + 1} = gamma * t_k.
    c1 : float
        Armijo's constant for line search in Newton's method.
    lasso_duality_gap : callable object or None.
        If calable the signature is lasso_duality_gap(x, Ax_b, ATAx_b, b, regcoef)
        Returns duality gap value for esimating the progress of method.
    trace : bool
        If True, the progress information is appended into history dictionary
        during training. Otherwise None is returned instead of history.
    display : bool
        If True, debug information is displayed during optimization.
        Printing format is up to a student and is not checked in any way.

    Returns
    -------
    (x_star, u_star) : tuple of np.array
        The point found by the optimization procedure.
    message : string
        "success" or the description of error:
            - 'iterations_exceeded': if after max_iter iterations of the method x_k still doesn't satisfy
                the stopping criterion.
            - 'computational_error': in case of getting Infinity or None value during the computations.
    history : dictionary of lists or None
        Dictionary containing the progress information or None if trace=False.
        Dictionary has to be organized as follows:
            - history['time'] : list of floats, containing time in seconds passed from the start of the method
            - history['func'] : list of function values f(x_k) on every **outer** iteration of the algorithm
            - history['duality_gap'] : list of duality gaps
            - history['x'] : list of np.arrays, containing the trajectory of the algorithm. ONLY STORE IF x.size <= 2
    """
    return (x, u), message, history
