    Subgradient descent method for nonsmooth convex optimization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    oracle : BaseNonsmoothConvexOracle-descendant object
        Oracle with .func() and .subgrad() methods implemented for computing
        function value and its one (arbitrary) subgradient respectively.
        If available, .duality_gap() method is used for estimating f_k - f*.
    x_0 : 1-dimensional np.array
        Starting point of the algorithm
    tolerance : float
        Epsilon value for stopping criterion.
    max_iter : int
        Maximum number of iterations.
    alpha_0 : float
        Initial value for the sequence of step-sizes.
    display : bool
        If True, debug information is displayed during optimization.
        Printing format is up to a student and is not checked in any way.
    trace:  bool
        If True, the progress information is appended into history dictionary during training.
        Otherwise None is returned instead of history.

    Returns
    -------
    x_star : np.array
        The point found by the optimization procedure
    message : string
        'success' or the description of error:
            - 'iterations_exceeded': if after max_iter iterations of the method x_k still doesn't satisfy
              the stopping criterion.
    history : dictionary of lists or None
        Dictionary containing the progress information or None if trace=False.
        Dictionary has to be organized as follows:
            - history['func'] : list of function values phi(x_k) on every step of the algorithm
            - history['time'] : list of floats, containing time in seconds passed from the start of the method
            - history['duality_gap'] : list of duality gaps

    ----------
